## RSSReaderDemonstrationApp

### Roots

Most of time the subject was to develop a small  RSS reader application and each of times with different contrains. This project is a mix of all the RSS reader I had to develop.

The main goal of the application is to highlight the best practices of the Objective-C development by using the design patterns.
